### why does Chrome not allow me to access www.facebook.com with a fake domain?

Because:

- Facebook use `Strict-Transport-Security` in return header
- `preload` is used

This is a Chrome specific thing, users using other browsers still can access if they accept the risk.

Chrome maintains a list of website using `preload`. Websites must submit themselves to Chrome and pass certain requirements to be listed in this list.

To submit go to: [https://hstspreload.org/](https://hstspreload.org/)
