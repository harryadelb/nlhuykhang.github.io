# Introduction

Over the past two months, I have been working on an interesting project at my company which is supposed to be a very big one. So at first, as a team leader and core maker, I spent quite a lot of time to find a good starting point which satisfies all the project's requirements. By starting point, I mean stuffs like how to structure the project, which frontend stack to use, how that stack connects to server, how to set up and bring all those things together etc...

Finally, I settled down with Meteor for backend, React for frontend, and Vanilajs ES6 MVC for the app extension (this is the most interesting part of the project, it will have its own post later). At first thing went well and smooth, needless to say that React is very good it is something that change the way I think when program.

But soon later, because this is the first time I really get on to build a big project with react, thing started to get messy. I encountered the problem that every big project coded in React has. This post is about that problem and how I attempt to solve it.
