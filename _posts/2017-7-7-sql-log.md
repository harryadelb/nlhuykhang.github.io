CREATE TABLE creates a new table.
INSERT INTO adds a new row to a table.
SELECT queries data from a table.
UPDATE edits a row in a table.
ALTER TABLE changes an existing table.
DELETE FROM deletes rows from a table.

- = equals
- != not equals
- > greater than
- < less than
- >= greater than or equal to
- <= less than or equal to
- LIKE is a special operator used with the WHERE clause to search for a specific pattern in a column
- % is a wildcard character that matches zero or more missing letters in the pattern.
    + A% matches all movies with names that begin with "A"
    + %a matches all movies that end with "a"
- AND is an operator that combines two conditions
- OR is an operator that filters the result set to only include rows where either condition is true
- ORDER BY is a clause that indicates you want to sort the result set by a particular column either alphabetically or numerically



- SELECT is the clause you use every time you want to query information from a database.
- WHERE is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.
- LIKE and BETWEEN are special operators that can be used in a WHERE clause
- AND and OR are special operators that you can use with WHERE to filter the query on two or more conditions.
- ORDER BY lets you sort the results of the query in either ascending or descending order.
- LIMIT lets you specify the maximum number of rows that the query will return. This is especially important in large tables that have thousands or even millions of rows.

- Aggregate functions combine multiple rows together to form a single value of more meaningful information.
- COUNT takes the name of a column(s) as an argument and counts the number of rows where the value(s) is not NULL.
- GROUP BY is a clause used with aggregate functions to combine data from one or more columns.
- SUM() takes the column name as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in that column.
- MAX() takes the column name as an argument and returns the largest value in that column.
- MIN() takes the column name as an argument and returns the smallest value in that column.
- AVG() takes a column name as an argument and returns the average value for that column.
- ROUND() takes two arguments, a column name and the number of decimal places to round the values in that column.


CREATE TABLE artists(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);


- A foreign key is a column that contains the primary key of another table in the database. We use foreign keys and primary keys to connect rows in two different tables. One table's foreign key holds the value of another table's primary key. Unlike primary keys, foreign keys do not need to be unique and can be NULL.


SELECT albums.name, albums.year, artists.name
FROM albums, artists;

SELECT
  *
FROM
  albums
JOIN artists ON
  albums.artist_id = artists.id;


SELECT
  *
FROM
  albums
LEFT JOIN artists ON
  albums.artist_id = artists.id;


SELECT
  albums.name AS 'Album',
  albums.year,
  artists.name AS 'Artist'
FROM
  albums
JOIN artists ON
  albums.artist_id = artists.id
WHERE
  albums.year > 1980;


- Primary Key is a column that serves a unique identifier for row in the table. Values in this column must be unique and cannot be NULL.
- Foreign Key is a column that contains the primary key to another table in the database. It is used to identify a particular row in the referenced table.
- Joins are used in SQL to combine data from multiple tables.
  + INNER JOIN will combine rows from different tables if the join condition is true.
  + LEFT OUTER JOIN will return every row in the left table, and if the join condition is not met, NULL values are used to fill in the columns from the right table.
- AS is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table in the result set using an alias.

- Subqueries are used to complete an SQL transformation by nesting one query within another query.
- A non-correlated subquery is a subquery that can be run independently of the outer query and can be used to complete a multi-step transformation.
- A correlated subquery is a subquery that cannot be run independently of the outer query. The order of operations in a correlated subquery is as follows:
  + A row is processed in the outer query.
  + Then, for that particular row in the outer query, the subquery is executed.


SELECT brand FROM legacy_products

SELECT brand FROM new_products;

SELECT brand FROM legacy_products

) as a

SELECT category FROM new_products
INTERSECT
SELECT category FROM legacy_products;

SELECT category FROM legacy_products
EXCEPT
SELECT category FROM new_products;

- UNION clause allows us to utilize information from multiple tables in our queries.
- UNION ALL clause allows us to utilize information from multiple tables in our queries, including duplicate values.
- INTERSECT is used to combine two SELECT statements, but returns rows only from the first SELECT statement that are identical to a row in the second SELECT statement.
- EXCEPT returns distinct rows from the first SELECT statement that arenâ€™t output by the second SELECT statement

- Conditional Aggregates are aggregate functions the compute a result set based on a given set of conditions.
- NULL can be used to denote an empty field value
- CASE statements allow for custom classification of data
- CASE statements can be used inside aggregates (like SUM() and COUNT()) to provide filtered measures
