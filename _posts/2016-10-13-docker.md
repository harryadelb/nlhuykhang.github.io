Docker Daemon - The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers. The daemon is the process that runs in the operation system to which clients talk to.

`docker run -d -P --name static-site prakhar1989/static-site`
-d: to detach
-P: export all exposed ports to random ports on the host
--name: correspond the name we want to give
-p host_port:exposed_port

`docker stop container_id`: to stop detach mode container

**Base images** are images that have no parent image, usually images with an OS like ubuntu, busybox or debian.
**Child images** are images that build on base images and add additional functionality.

The onbuild version of the image includes helpers that automate the boring parts of getting an app running

docker build -t khangnlh/name .

The bridge network is the network in which containers are run by default. So that means that when I ran the ES container, it was running in this bridge network

`docker stop $(docker ps -q)`

`docker exec -it ID /bin/sh`


`docker images -f "dangling=true" -q`

`docker run -d ubuntu:18:04 tail -f /dev/null`
